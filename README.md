# Scene Helpers for the Foundry VTT

A couple of user interface modifications to help handling scenes a bit easier:

- Clicking on a scene in the scene list views the scene instead of opening its configuration
- When the currently viewed scene has "Toggle Navigation" enabled, a pin icon will be shown in the scene entry to indicate it will stay open when navigating away from it
- Clicking on a scene in the navigation bar with Alt/Command pressed will toggle the navigation/pin status of that scene
- Double clicking the active scene will open the scene notes or the scene configuration (selectable in settings)
